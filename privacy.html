          Information is collected from you when you submit your details on our site. The information we collect is clearly set out on the web page on which we collect it.

        <div class="section-title" >
          <p>We do not disclose your information to anyone</p>
          We will not pass on information about you to anyone without your prior consent. If you give your consent, we will pass your contact details to third parties who may then occasionally send communications to you to provide information, offers, and services that may be of interest to you. In certain circumstances we may need to disclose information about you if you breach this privacy policy or if you breach our Terms and Conditions.

          <p>Data Protection</p>

          <p>Security</p>
          Keeping your information secure is very important to us and certain sections of the site may encrypt data using SSL or a comparable standard. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure. As a result, whilst we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information which you send to us, and you do so at your own risk.

          <p>Cookie Policy</p>
          Most websites you visit will use cookies in order to improve your user experience by enabling that website to ’remember’ you, either for the duration of your visit (using a ’session cookie’) or for repeat visits (using a ’persistent cookie’). Some websites will also use cookies to enable them to target their advertising or marketing messages based, for parties not associated with the primary reason for data submission – See ICO guidance: “The GDPR sets a high standard for consent. But you often won’t need consent.” This can also be found in the EU legislation: Article 6 1(f) page 36 of REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

        <div class="section-title" >
          <p>Legitimate Interest Justification</p>
          The forms on our websites introduce a customer looking for the service in question. Other than customer satisfaction calls no further marketing or processing will be conducted by Cross The River Ltd. For this reason, we do not request or rely on ’consent’ as provided by opt in check boxes as the legal basis for data processing. This Opt in method is appropriate for Websites providing further data sharing with 3rd parties unrelated to the initial processing reason.
